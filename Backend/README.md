<p><b>Providing a Platform for Patients with Similar Diagnoses</b></p>

<p>Patients with similar diagnoses can benefit from communicating with each other and sharing their experiences. For example, individuals living with HIV/AIDS can share their experiences with others and provide support to each other. This type of communication helps to address the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, which can discourage individuals from seeking proper medical care.</p>

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model predicts the confidence of diseases based on user input symptoms. The ANN model is trained on dataset of medical records and is able to identify patterns in symptoms and provide accurate predictions of diseases with a high degree of confidence. This new feature will help users better understand the likelihood of their symptoms being associated with a particular disease and enable them to make more informed decisions about their health.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that predicts the severity of symptoms based on user-uploaded photos. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of medical images and is able to identify patterns in images and provide accurate predictions of symptom severity. </p>
